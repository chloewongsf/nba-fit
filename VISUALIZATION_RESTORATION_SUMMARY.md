# Visualization Restoration Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Missing Visualizations

Successfully restored the fit score components and scheme fit vs player fit visualizations that were accidentally removed during the season stats cleanup.

## 🔧 Root Cause

When I removed the duplicate season stats section, the visualizations were nested inside the `elif` branch that only executed for custom players or when NBA API data wasn't available. This meant NBA players using the new season averages DataFrame weren't seeing the visualizations.

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

### **Problem Structure (Before Fix):**
```python
# Display player stats if available
if selected_player and player_source == "NBA Player" and selected_player_id:
    # NBA players - season averages DataFrame
    season_averages_df = get_player_season_averages_df(...)
    # ❌ NO VISUALIZATIONS HERE

elif selected_player and player_stats_df is not None and not player_stats_df.empty:
    # Custom players - fallback DataFrame
    st.dataframe(player_stats_df, use_container_width=True)
    
    # ✅ Visualizations were only here (wrong!)
    if player_vec is not None:
        # Radar chart and fit score breakdown
```

### **Solution Structure (After Fix):**
```python
# Display player stats if available
if selected_player and player_source == "NBA Player" and selected_player_id:
    # NBA players - season averages DataFrame
    season_averages_df = get_player_season_averages_df(...)

elif selected_player and player_stats_df is not None and not player_stats_df.empty:
    # Custom players - fallback DataFrame
    st.dataframe(player_stats_df, use_container_width=True)

# ✅ Visualizations now show for ALL players
if player_vec is not None:
    # Radar chart and fit score breakdown
```
