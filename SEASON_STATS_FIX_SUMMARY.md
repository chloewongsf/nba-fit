# Season Stats Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Duplicate Season Stats Sections

Successfully removed the duplicate season stats section and updated the original one to use NBA API data with proper season averages.

## 🔧 Root Cause

There were two season stats sections:
1. **New section** - Added with big numbers/metrics display
2. **Original section** - Database/DataFrame display (kept this one)

The original section was using individual game data instead of season averages.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### **1. Removed Duplicate Section:**
- ❌ **Removed**: New season stats section with big numbers/metrics
- ✅ **Kept**: Original season stats section with database display

### **2. Enhanced Data API (`data_api.py`):**

#### **Added Season Averages DataFrame Function:**
```python
def get_player_season_averages_df(player_id: int, season: str = DEFAULT_SEASON) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Get player season averages as a DataFrame for display."""
    # Converts season stats dict to properly formatted DataFrame
    # Rounds to appropriate decimal places
    # Returns single row with season averages
```

### **3. Updated App Logic (`app.py`):**

#### **Updated Season Stats Display:**
```python
# For NBA players - use NBA API season averages
if selected_player and player_source == "NBA Player" and selected_player_id:
    season_averages_df = get_player_season_averages_df(selected_player_id, CURRENT_SEASON)
    # Display "Candidate's Season Stats" with season averages

# For custom players - fallback to original logic
elif selected_player and player_stats_df is not None and not player_stats_df.empty:
    # Display "Candidate's Season Stats" with custom player data
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### **Before (Broken):**
```
NBA Player → Individual Game Data → Database Display (Wrong Data)
Custom Player → Custom Stats → Database Display
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
NBA Player → Game Logs → Season Averages → Database Display (Correct Data)
Custom Player → Custom Stats → Database Display
```

## 🧪 Testing Results
