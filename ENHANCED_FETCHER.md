# Enhanced NBA Data Fetcher

## 🚀 Reliable Data Fetching Complete!

Your `fetch_data.py` script has been enhanced with robust features for reliably fetching all active NBA players' game logs.

## ✨ New Features

### **🔄 Retry Mechanism**
- **3 retry attempts** by default for failed requests
- **Smart retry logic** - only retries on network/timeout/rate limit errors
- **Configurable retries** - use `--retries N` to set custom retry count
- **Longer delays on retry** - 2-second delay between retry attempts

### **📦 Chunking System**
- **50 players per chunk** by default (configurable with `--chunk-size`)
- **Progress saved after each chunk** - can restart without losing progress
- **Clear chunk boundaries** - see exactly which players are being processed
- **Chunk summaries** - success/failure counts per chunk

### **⏱️ Rate Limiting Protection**
- **1-second delay** between all requests
- **2-second delay** on retry attempts
- **Respectful API usage** - won't overwhelm the NBA API

### **📊 Enhanced Progress Tracking**
- **Player-by-player progress** - "Fetching player X of Y (player_id) - Player Name"
- **Chunk progress** - shows which chunk is being processed
- **Overall progress** - running totals across all chunks
- **Final summary** - complete success/failure statistics

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### **Fetch All Active Players (Recommended)**
```bash
# Fetch all active players with default settings
python3 fetch_data.py --all

# Fetch all players with custom chunk size
python3 fetch_data.py --all --chunk-size 25

# Fetch all players with custom retry count
python3 fetch_data.py --all --retries 5

# Fetch limited number of players (for testing)
python3 fetch_data.py --all --max 100
```

### **Fetch Popular Players**
```bash
# Fetch curated list of popular players
python3 fetch_data.py --popular
```

### **Fetch Specific Players**
```bash
# Fetch specific player IDs
python3 fetch_data.py --players 201939 2544 203999

# Fetch with custom retry settings
python3 fetch_data.py --players 201939 --retries 5
```

### **Different Seasons**
```bash
# Fetch data for different season
python3 fetch_data.py --all --season 2023-24
```

## 📁 Output Format

### **File Naming**
- **Format**: `{player_id}_{season}.csv`
- **Season normalization**: `2024-25` becomes `2024_25`
- **Example**: `201939_2024_25.csv` (Stephen Curry)

### **CSV Content**
- **Game log data** - individual game statistics
- **All columns** from NBA API game log endpoint
- **Ready for conversion** to per-game averages in the Streamlit app

## 🛡️ Reliability Features

### **Error Handling**
- **Network errors** - automatically retried
- **Timeout errors** - automatically retried  
- **Rate limit errors** - automatically retried
- **Non-retryable errors** - logged and skipped
- **Missing players** - gracefully handled

### **Progress Persistence**
- **Chunk-based processing** - progress saved after each chunk
- **Restart capability** - can restart script and continue from where it left off
- **No data loss** - completed chunks are preserved

### **API Respect**
- **Rate limiting** - 1-second delay between requests
- **Retry delays** - 2-second delay on retry attempts
- **Chunking** - processes players in manageable batches

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### **For Full Data Collection:**
```bash
# 1. Start with a small test
python3 fetch_data.py --all --max 10 --chunk-size 5

# 2. If successful, fetch all players
python3 fetch_data.py --all --chunk-size 50

# 3. Monitor progress and restart if needed
# (Script will continue from where it left off)

# 4. Commit the results
git add data/
git commit -m "Update player data for 2024-25"
git push
```

### **For Regular Updates:**
```bash
# Update popular players weekly
python3 fetch_data.py --popular

# Update specific players as needed
python3 fetch_data.py --players 201939 2544 203999
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### **Time Estimates:**
- **~1 second per player** (including delays)
- **~500+ active players** in a season
- **~8-10 minutes** for all players (with 1-second delays)
- **Chunking allows** for restarts and monitoring

### **Success Rates:**
- **95%+ success rate** expected for active players
- **Retry mechanism** handles most temporary failures
- **Graceful handling** of missing/inactive players

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### **Progress Indicators:**
- **Player progress** - shows current player being processed
- **Chunk progress** - shows which chunk is active
- **Overall progress** - running totals
- **Error details** - specific error messages for failures

### **Restart Capability:**
- **Chunk-based saves** - progress preserved after each chunk
- **No duplicate work** - existing CSV files are not overwritten
- **Resume from interruption** - restart script to continue

### **Error Analysis:**
- **Retry attempts** - shows which players required retries
- **Failure reasons** - specific error messages
- **Success rates** - per-chunk and overall statistics

## 🎉 Result

After running the enhanced fetcher:

1. **Complete dataset** - CSV file for every active NBA player
2. **Reliable data** - retry mechanism handles API issues
3. **Progress tracking** - know exactly what's happening
4. **Restart capability** - can resume if interrupted
5. **Ready for deployment** - commit CSVs to GitHub for Streamlit app

Your data collection is now production-ready and reliable! 🏀
