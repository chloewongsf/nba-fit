# CSV-Only NBA Fit System

## 🚀 Complete Refactor Complete!

Your Streamlit app now runs **100% offline** using only cached CSV files from the `data/` folder. All NBA API calls have been removed.

## ✅ What Was Changed

### **1. Removed NBA API Dependencies**
- **Removed imports**: `nba_api.stats.static.players`, `nba_api.stats.endpoints.playercareerstats`
- **Removed all API calls**: No more `players.get_players()` or `playercareerstats.PlayerCareerStats()`
- **Removed try/except blocks**: No more NBA API error handling
- **Removed rate limiting**: No more delays or timeout logic

### **2. CSV-Only Data Loading**
- **Player stats**: Load from `data/{player_id}_{season}.csv` files
- **Active players**: Load from `data/active_players.csv` or fallback data
- **Season format support**: Handles both `2024-25` and `2024_25` formats
- **Automatic conversion**: Game log data converted to per-game averages

### **3. Enhanced Debug Logging**
- **Clear file loading messages**: Shows exactly which CSV files are being loaded
- **Missing file warnings**: Clear messages when CSV files don't exist
- **Data source indicators**: Shows whether data comes from cache, CSV, or fallback

## 📁 File Structure

### **Data Directory (`data/`):**
```
data/
├── active_players.csv          # 615 active NBA players
├── player_stats.csv           # Fallback stats for popular players
├── 201939_2024-25.csv         # Stephen Curry game log data
├── 1630173_2024-25.csv        # Precious Achiuwa game log data
└── ... (more player CSV files as needed)
```

### **CSV File Format:**
- **Individual player files**: `{player_id}_{season}.csv` (e.g., `201939_2024-25.csv`)
- **Game log data**: Contains individual game statistics
- **Automatic conversion**: Converted to per-game averages for the app

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Data Loading Flow:**
```
1. Check cache for player stats
   ↓ (if not found)
2. Look for CSV file: data/{player_id}_{season}.csv
   ↓ (if not found)
3. Try alternative season format: data/{player_id}_{season_alt}.csv
   ↓ (if not found)
4. Use fallback CSV data
   ↓ (if not found)
5. Show warning: "No cached stats available"
```

### **Season Format Support:**
- **Primary**: `2024-25` (standard NBA season format)
- **Alternative**: `2024_25` (underscore format)
- **Automatic detection**: Uses `os.path.exists()` to check both formats

### **Game Log to Per-Game Conversion:**
- **Input**: Game log CSV with individual game stats
- **Output**: Per-game averages in the expected format
- **Fields calculated**: PTS, REB, AST, FG_PCT, FG3_PCT, FT_PCT, etc.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### **For Development:**
```bash
# Generate CSV files for players
python3 fetch_data.py

# Run the app (100% offline)
streamlit run app.py
```

### **For Production:**
1. **Generate CSV files** using `fetch_data.py`
2. **Commit CSV files** to your GitHub repository
3. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** - app runs completely offline
4. **No API dependencies** - works even if NBA API is completely blocked

### **Adding New Players:**
```bash
# Edit fetch_data.py to add more player IDs
# Run the script to generate their CSV files
python3 fetch_data.py

# Commit the new CSV files
git add data/
git commit -m "Add CSV data for new players"
git push
```

## 📊 Current Data Status

### **Available Players:**
- **Stephen Curry** (201939): 70 games, 24.5 PPG

- **615 active players** in fallback list
- **10 popular players** with hardcoded stats

### **Data Sources:**
- **Cache**: Fast loading for recently accessed players
